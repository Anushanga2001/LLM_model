### Large Language Model Project

This project involves the development of a large language model using Python and key libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow. The focus is on preparing a robust dataset, processing it through tokenization and input sequencing, and training the model to predict the next words in a sentence based on the input.

#### Project Highlights:
- **Data Preparation:** The project begins with collecting and filtering the dataset, ensuring it is clean and suitable for training. This step also involves tokenizing the text and creating input sequences to feed into the model.
- **Model Training:** The model is trained using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) algorithm, which is well-suited for processing sequential data and understanding the context of words in a sentence.
- **Prediction:** Once trained, the model can predict subsequent words in a sentence based on a given input word, demonstrating its ability to understand and generate language patterns.

This project showcases my skills in working with large datasets, implementing deep learning algorithms, and building predictive models that can generate meaningful text outputs based on training data.
